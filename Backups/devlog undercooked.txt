movement and collisions

30 august
-rewrote marker code so it would snap to blocks correctly/ be reusable for other functions
-wrote a food object which allows for picking up and placing food
-TODO chopping meat, frying meat, combining food, picking up plates, renaming food objects to obj as i will use type for frying pan and plates etc

31 august
-refactored food to obj and reused it for pan
-food can't be placed on top of other food unless they are compatible and combine
-chopping meat and cheeze is possible with the implementation of nextid()
-frying meat is possible (but requires manual input) to produce burger_cooked
-combining food is now possible (you can now create an hamburger from bun and pan_meat_cooked, as well as hamburger_cheeze)
-When dropping food intro trash can it disappears
-Fixed disappearing frying pan using two if-statements as you want frying pan to remain stationary in hand or in obj_arr

TODO
-AFK frying
-One press on action key allows you to cut entire product instead of multiple
-Plates
-Order list
-Points
-2-players
-sprite compression using flipped tiles
-Washing dishes and dirty dishes
-throwing food

1 september
-Restructured draw_p_inventory() so that it is drawn differently based on player direction.
-One button press to cook and chop food using p-acting. Cook food is still not possible afk but doesn't require multiple keypresses. Solve by using action states?
-Added a timer and score
-Added double cheeze burger
-Added afk cooking
-Added music
-Added sfx although frying sfx is not working right now. Will need to implement a SFX manager

2 september
-Attempted to create a git repo
-Tokens before refactoring = 2093
-Started working on revamping code. Created an id function that will alow for easier sprite rendering and id checking. Used to mirror sprites for instance.
-Id was previously a single number. Now it is a function instead
-p-inv now holds id instead of a single tile number. will redo so player holds an object instead.
-Tokens after removal and rework of g_id = 2040 phase 1
-Phase 2: 2038
-Smoothed out progress bar when cooking (8 steps instead of 4)
-Made some more detailed pixel art but decided it didn't fit the style of the game (saved as .p8 with fidelity in title)
-Started working on the throwing mechanic, which requires some rewriting of rendering of ids. Ids can't be rendered at the 8x8 grid.
-Update id's can be rendered with the same renderer. x and y will contain decimal values instead which will be multiplied
-Throwing sort of works but there are different throwing speeds in different directions

3 september
-Added a map function which can be used to load different maps. Stores map x,y values and player values etc.
-Buggy when loading different coordinates. Pans don't load in correct place. Player collision doesn't work. Need to make offset value to fix. Can't be bothered to fix now.
-Added double hamburger without cheeze
-Added nicer ui for orders using sprite stretching
-Cut clock sprite size in half
-Timer text is now automatically centered on clock
-Added some more shade to burgers (red color)
-Made a burger with lettuce sprite
-Altered time controls slightly
-Made a lettuce sprite
-Changed color of progressbar to reflect temperature of meat (cold to hot ie blue to red to yellow)
-Bug with throwing food fast upwards is connected to qntz_y which always get triggered on flag condition?
-Because p_inv carries id and not objects progress is reset when player picks up an object
-Fix will be changing p_inv to carry objects, this will simplify throwing mechanics hopefully
-p_inv now carries objects instead of ids
-p_inv no longer shows progress of object picked up, solution is ugly and a bit too manual
-better progress bar when pan_burger_cooked is on stove goes from checkmark to warning sign
-bought pico-8
-published demo online, it is currently too difficult. should introduce more levels.
-fixed map scaling by introducing map offsets using m.x and m.y to all mget and fget functions
-level table now works
-removed time increases on succesful delivery (no longer arcade but more similar to original)
-token count: 2588
-bug found where if you drop food from pan next time you use pan it duplicates
-removed map_based start coordinates for p_x & p_y now game automatically finds suitable position
-added bun_cheeze to allow for easier prepping of food
-added outlines for levels

4 september
-Added level outlines for all levels
-Ui for orders look a bit weird because it is obviously scaled
-Just realized marker and map use the same abbreviation :/ m.x vs m_x. This is confusing af.
-Because pans are not throwable there might be a need for a major refactor
-Throwing now works, but objects duplicate when thrown and landing in pan
-Fixed duplication glitch
-Player movement wonky when you want to throw. Will fix it by adding one keytap to change direction
-Added one keytap to change direction but still feels wonky, fix by disabling movement when holding throw button?
-Disabled movement when holding throw button, still looks weird lol. Had a lot o issues with double tapping. Fixed it with a toogle bool called pcklast. Maybe force user to hold down button to hold item?
-Made it less wonky as you can now throw it immediatly after pickup by holding down button and releasing
-Bug: Pan duplicates when throwing food
-When a burger_raw sits on pan_burger_cooked, and player picks up pan_burger_cooked a new pan is created
-Bug: All food dissapears when placed on deliver shelf.
-Fixed bug: All food dissapears when placed on deliver shelf.
-Code is currently super messy, decided to refactor code. 2984 tokens before
-Trash can swallows pan now
-Fixed trash can swallows pan
-Progress bars are always drawn over player now
-21:56 2954 tokens
-22:16 2949 tokens
-22:27 2933 tokens
-22:42 2919 tokens
-22:45 2880 tokens
-There is now a glitch where bun glitches out when holding bun, probably related to throwing mechanic, and change of rendering for p_inv
-Kind of a sad development session :( So many bugs and glitches
-Made a first prototype of level selection screen with ufo theme.

5 september
-Decided to start over from scratch. The game had gotten too complex and required many major structural changes to become viable as a larger game.
-Started testing on object types and their information stored to minimize and simplify creation and debugging of object interaction.
-After a lot of work I decided to use a recipe book as the original idea of having each object store their combinations made things confusing and difficult as they often referenced undeclared objects.

6 september
-Added draw functions to objects
-Added a player object
-Added all recipes
-Tested recipe combinations
-Added update functions
-Added movement
-Out of memory bug related to pobjs??!!!
-Related to pobj_arr draws
-Pobj replaced the draw function in obj which meant that the self-referential nature wasn't working
-Pobj_arr all have the same x and y values for same obj type
-Researching inheritance in lua

7 september
-Rewrote pobj function to avoid linkage to food objects
-Player animations now work
-Added collision detection
-Added simple drawing of marker in player object
-Changed player drawing to account for position (maybe only when collides?)
-Player changing position looked bad wven when accounting for collides(it made movement confusing and code illegible)
-Added p.pickup()
-Added inventory draw function that accounts for position TODO flip pan
TODO
-p.drop()

8 september
-Added p.drop()
-Experimented with smooth player movement (looked weird)
-Experiment used a offset value which moved player slowly when moving
-Fixed bug with p.inv.draw(x,y) tiles not rendering correctly
-Added flip value to drawing of objects
-Chopping first draft, bug when moving currently
-Chopping added. Difficult at first setting object to next object internally. Used pobj for this

23 september
-Long break from programming, lost a lot of motivation on the project
-Started working on the menu and order system
-Objects have defined time a customer is willing to wait for
-Dishes are objects with added TTL (time to live value which decrements on dish.update()
-Copied menu system over from previous version of game
-Banners and food now work, although rnd(lvl.menu) returns a nil value
-lvl.menu wasn't working because there was no initialization for the different menus
-number of tokens is now 2290, not a huge amount of tokens saved :(
-Still no throwing mechanic :(
-Still no score or timer
-score and timer added: token count 2428
-game over screen added: token count 2470
-TODO level selct screen
-Level selection screen now works
-Added ship movement smoothing
-Added new level with many corridors
-TODO multiplayer mode
-TODO fix bug where you can chop any object on any material

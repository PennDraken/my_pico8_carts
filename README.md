# my_pico8_carts

## What is this repo?

This repo is used as a quick backup for some of my carts (programs) for the fantasy console Pico-8. It contains many different kind of programs of varying quality and doneness.  

A highlight in terms of quality is the game Skidor which is in a release-ready state. You're a skier trying to get to the bottom of a difficult hill. On the way down you'll have to avoid various obstacles. For the perfectionist there's a built in timer, so you can challenge yourself to beat your high score.
